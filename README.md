## Project Overview

This function library provides essential utilities for garden management, covering container calculations, plant spacing, seasonal planning, and soil management. These functions serve as the foundation for future object-oriented development in our garden management system.


## Function Library Overview

Our library contains 15 specialized functions related to the gardening project. These include:

calculate_area - calculates area of each container  
validate_container_dimensions - validates that the sizes are reasonable  
measurement_conversion - converts measurements of inches, centimeters and feet  
calculate_soil_volume - calculates volume of soil needed for each container  
validate_boolean_input - validates if input is a Boolean input  
format_planting_date - formats the date in YYYY-MM-DD  
parse_plant_species - extracts first word of scientific plant name  
is_valid_ph_level - validates that pH number is an integer between 0-14  
calculate_plant_space - calculates estimated space between containers  
calculate_compost_needed - calculates amount of compost needed based on soil volume  
calculate_season_change - calculates in days when season will change  
to_date - inputs date of planted plant  
days_until_frost - calculates in days when first frost date is  
is_safe_to_plant - checks if a plant is safe to plant based on frost  
estimate_harvest_yield - estimates total harvest yield  

## Team Member Contributions

Caden Ennis - created ReadMe/created calculate_area, validate_container_measurement, measurement_conversion, calculate_soil_volume  
Sara Shokouhian - created validate_boolean_input, format_planting_date, parse_plant_species, is_valid_ph_level  
Joshua Henderson - created to_date, days_until_frost, is_safe_to_plant, estimate_harvest_yield  
Mai-Tien Pham - calculate_plant_space, calculate_compost_needed, calculate_season_change  

## Problem Statement

We believed that Professor Dempwolf needed help in organizing and managing his garden, so we have come together to create a program to make managing his garden easier for him.  

## Code Review 

Each team member's code has been reviewed by another teammate and has been approved. 

## AI Usage

AI has been used in our project to make writing our intended code faster by using the predictive text assistance built into VSC, but it was never used to generate our code entirely.
