## Project Overview

This function library provides essential utilities for garden management, covering container calculations, plant spacing, seasonal planning, and soil management. These functions serve as the foundation for future object-oriented development in our garden management system.


## Function Library Overview

Our library contains 15 specialized functions related to the gardening project. These include:

calculate_area - calculates area of each container  
validate_container_dimensions - validates that the sizes are reasonable  
measurement_conversion - converts measurements of inches, centimeters and feet  
calculate_soil_volume - calculates volume of soil needed for each container  
validate_boolean_input - validates if input is a Boolean input  
format_planting_date - formats the date in YYYY-MM-DD  
parse_plant_species - extracts first word of scientific plant name  
is_valid_ph_level - validates that pH number is an integer between 0-14  
calculate_plant_space - calculates estimated space between containers  
calculate_compost_needed - calculates amount of compost needed based on soil volume  
calculate_season_change - calculates in days when season will change  
to_date - inputs date of planted plant  
days_until_frost - calculates in days when first frost date is  
is_safe_to_plant - checks if a plant is safe to plant based on frost  
estimate_harvest_yield - estimates total harvest yield
